# CRUD REST API for Contacts

This project is built using [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless) with Nodejs. It includes 5 functions, each executing a specific business process (Create, Update, Delete, List and Retrieve), and each triggered by an API Gateway.

### Deployment

```
$ serverless deploy
```

After deploying, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-node-http-api-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-http-api-project-dev (152s)
