This project is built using [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless) with Nodejs. It includes 5 functions, each executing a specific business process (Create, Update, Delete, List and Retrieve), and each triggered by an API Gateway.

### Tools

- Serverless Framework
- Nodejs
- DynamoDb
- API Gateway
- Aws-sdk


### Continuous Deployment

To get **SERVERLESS_ACCESS_KEY**, you should follow [this](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/guides/cicd/running-in-your-own-cicd).

The deployment supports multi-stage based on these branche names: 
  - main: "prod" 
  - develop: "dev" 

After deploying, you should see output after the `Serverless Deploy` step in the workflow similar to:

```bash
Deploying sls-crud to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack sls-crud-dev (152s)

endpoint: GET - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```
